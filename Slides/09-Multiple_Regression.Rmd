# Checklist / Suggested Outline

* Overview slide
	* Context on the data collection
	* Description of the dependent variable (what is being measured)
	* Description of the independent variable (what is being measured; include at least 2 variables)
	* Research question
* Summary statistics
* Include appropriate data visualizations.
* Statistical output
	* Include the appropriate statistics for your method used.
	* For null hypothesis tests (e.g. t-test, chi-squared, ANOVA, etc.), state the null and alternative hypotheses along with relevant statistic and p-value (and confidence interval if appropriate).
	* For regression models, include the regression output and interpret the R-squared value.
* Conclusion
	* Why is this analysis important?
	* Limitations of the analysis?

# Criteria for Grading

* Data is presented to support the conslusions using the appropriate analysis (i.e. the statistical method chosen supports the research question).

* Suitable tables summarize data in a clear and meaningful way even to those unfamiliar with the project.

* Suitable graphics summarize data in a clear and meaningful way even to those unfamiliar with the project.

* Data reviewed and analyzed accurately and coherently.

* Proper use of descriptive and/or inferential statistics.
