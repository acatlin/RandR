The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) is a formative assessment designed to provide you with information about key college skills. DAACS includes assessments in self-regulated learning, mathematics, reading, and writing. **YOU ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING ASSESSMENT**. This should take about 10 minutes to complete the assessment and there is no passing or failing. Once you are done, I encourage you to review the resources recommended to you. We will use the aggregated results in class. To get credit for this assignment:

1. Go to [demo.daacs.net](https://demo.daacs.net)
2. Create an account.
3. Complete the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) assessment.
4. Enter the email address you used in step 2 in Blackboard.
